# Cosmic_Classifier
Hi everyone! This project of ours focuses on classifying planets based on features like gravity, temperature, and water content (Classification Model). I and my team built nine models—three each with LightGBM, Neural Networks, and XGBoost—and combined them into a single soft-voting ensemble model to improve prediction accuracy.
